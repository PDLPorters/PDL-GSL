PDL interface to GSL by Christian Pellegrin <chri@infis.univ.ts.it>,
Copyleft, 1999 see COPYING in the root of the PDL build tree.
The documentation is in the .pd file and is automaticaly generated.

We need:

  - an example for every function (C<=for example> section in docs).
  - a test for every SF function (to go into t/gsl_sf.t)

Patches by GSL users are most welcome!
